The Idea is to create a touch functional user interface like Star Trek LCARS.
A terminal command promt will be at the bottom of the screen at all the times. 
All of the commands will be listed in an overlay and when you touch the comman it will transfer it to the prompt then access options form the help file and place those on the screen allong with directory and file information incase you are trying to open or acess a file. 
Window functionality will be included and the scail of your screen or area to display windows is unlimited kind of like prezie zooming functionality if you zoom in and out to see differnt things. 
Say you opend a web browser it would zoom in transitioning from the browser icon till the open browser fills the screen so to see the just opened web browser you would pinch to zoom out and select the browser to zoom in. now lets say you want more then one window to display just select all the windows you want to see together and you will see them. this gives a dynamic foundation for any size or type of display that can use jesturs, void, and many other forms of controle input inclulding standard input.
I see this as becoming a revolution in the way that people interact with their computers. This should be a fully functioning linux desktop with all the features of platforms like Gnome, KDE and cinnamon.
There are several questions to address:
1. what would be the best language for this desktop environment.
2. will Wayland be a good backend for this platform or is there something else that would work better.
3. are there LCARS libs that are open source that will etcelerate the development of this environment 
4. what shell provides the best support for this type of an interference? compare to zsh.
5. are there any aspects of this implementation that i have not covered that may need more definition?
